Welcome to the online book of Qt5 Cadaques! Why Qt5? Because Qt5 is awesome! Why Cadaques? Because one of the authors had a great holiday in this rocky coastline in the north-east of Spain.

The entire collection of chapters covering Qt5 programming, written by Juergen Bocklage-Ryannel and Johan Thelin, is available here.

We are heavily working on this book and that means several things:

#. **It's not done**. We will be releasing new chapters from time to time and updating existing chapters on the go.
#. **We love your support**. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please use our feedback system (the issues links). It will create a new ticket-entry in our ticket system and help us to keep track.
#. **Be patient.** We are working in our spare time on the book and we depend on the support of our companies and family.

**Enjoy!**
